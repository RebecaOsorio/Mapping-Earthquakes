# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
To complete this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and then added the data to a map.
We also added used the GitHub Repository [Tectonic Plates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates), to retieve the coordinates and add the Tectonic Plates - polygons, to a layer in the map.

## Approach
We used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
